### Abstract

Third-party libraries (TPLs) are a cornerstone of mobile app development, but their use of anycast-based communications raises serious privacy concerns. This article presents the first large-scale study examining how anycast addresses‚Äîused by TPLs for global service delivery‚Äîlead to undisclosed international personal data transfers.

The authors analyzed 5,759 Android apps and found that nearly 99% of those transferring data via anycast do not disclose these transfers in their privacy policies. Furthermore, 90% of the identified TPLs potentially violate GDPR transparency requirements. The study highlights the role of Unity Ads, Google Mobile Ads, and other dominant TPLs in triggering most of these flows, often without meaningful developer control or visibility.

### Key Contributions

- üåç Analysis of 5,759 Android apps and 4.2M+ network connections, identifying 200 anycast IPs.
- üìâ 98.65% of apps and 90% of TPLs transferring data to non-EEA countries failed to disclose destinations.
- üîç Identified 20 key TPLs; Unity Ads alone was responsible for 57.08% of data flows.
- üìú Exposes the lack of standardized privacy policy publication and automation for TPLs.
- üß≠ Calls for ecosystem-wide changes: privacy manifests, app store enforcement, and network-level safeguards.
