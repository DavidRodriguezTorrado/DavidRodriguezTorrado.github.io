excerpt: 'This paper investigates how Android developers configure privacy-related settings when integrating the Facebook SDK and Audience Network SDK. Analyzing over 6,000 popular apps, the study finds that many retain default settings that are less privacy-friendly and fail to align with declared practices in privacy labels and policies. It offers recommendations for SDK providers to promote data minimization and improve transparency.'
