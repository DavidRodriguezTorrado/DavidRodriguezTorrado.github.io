### Abstract

This paper presents a fully automated method to assess the compliance of cross-border personal data transfers in Android applications with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The method combines dynamic traffic analysis and automated natural language processing of privacy policies to evaluate whether the apps properly disclose data transfers outside the European Union, as required by the GDPR.

The approach was applied to a dataset of 4,593 popular Android apps available in Spain. The results show that 33% of apps transferring personal data internationally failed to disclose this fact in their privacy policies, while 15% presented incomplete or inconsistent information. Only 19% of the apps analyzed were found to fully comply with GDPR transparency requirements.

### Key Contributions
