### Abstract

This paper introduces ROI (Receiver Organization Identifier), a method to identify the organizations receiving personal data from apps and digital services. Combining privacy policy analysis and WHOIS lookup, ROI achieves 95.71% precision, outperforming prior techniques like SSL inspection or WebXray.

To demonstrate ROI‚Äôs effectiveness in real-world scenarios, the method was applied to over 10,000 Android apps, identifying 1,112 unique domains receiving personal data. The study revealed that only 22% of apps properly disclose all recipients in their privacy policies, while 78% fail to meet transparency obligations.

### Key Contributions

- üì± Applied ROI to 10,000 Android apps, identifying 40,000+ personal data flows.
- üè¢ Identified recipients in 82% of flows, with Meta and Google leading.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Found that 78% of apps fail to properly disclose data recipients as required by the GDPR.
- üìà ROI combines named-entity recognition, privacy policy mining, and WHOIS for unmatched precision.
- üß™ Public datasets released with 1,112 recipient domains and their corresponding organizations.
