### Abstract

This paper introduces **ATLAS**, an automated system for detecting discrepancies between iOS app privacy policies and privacy labels. ATLAS includes a distributed scraping and classification pipeline, a scalable NLP-based classifier to predict privacy labels from privacy policies, and a discrepancy analysis framework to flag potential compliance issues.

The authors applied ATLAS to **354,725 iOS apps** and discovered that only 29.6% had both accessible privacy policies and privacy labels. Among them, **88%** had at least one discrepancy between their privacy label and policy text, with an average of **5.32 discrepancies per app**. These inconsistencies could signal issues with compliance under data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

### Key Contributions

- üß† Built a high-performance ensemble classifier (91.3% accuracy) to predict privacy labels from policy text across 32 data types.
- üì± Analyzed 354K iOS apps: only 29.6% provided both a privacy policy and a privacy label.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Found that 88.0% of those apps exhibited at least one potential discrepancy.
- üìâ Financial data types showed the highest policy incompleteness: e.g., 62.4% for Credit Info.
- üî¨ Released methodology for detecting missing or inconsistent disclosures at scale.
