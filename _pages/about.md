Welcome! I‚Äôm Teaching Assistant and Ph.D. in Privacy Engineering at the **Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM)**, working within the [STRAST](https://www.upm.es/recursosidi/map/sistemas-de-tiempo-real-y-arquitectura-de-servicios-telematicos/) research group (Real-Time Systems and Service Architecture for Telematics). My research focuses on the **automated assessment of privacy and data protection compliance** in ICT systems, especially in the context of Android mobile apps and GDPR regulation.

### üéì About me

Since 2023, I teach **Software Analysis and Design (ADSW)** to second-year students at the **Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicaci√≥n**, where I cover topics like software design, concurrent programming, and complexity analysis in Java.

Between 2021 and 2023, I worked as a Research Assistant at UPM, contributing to the nationally funded research project **AutoGDPR**, focused on automating the assessment of GDPR compliance, by doing privacy policy analysis and data flow auditing. Today, I continue this work as my main research line.

I currently serve as **Publicity Chair** for the [International Workshop on Privacy Engineering (IWPE 2025)](https://iwpe.info/), where I help coordinate outreach, promotion, and community engagement for the event.

### üåç International Research Collaboration
- **Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional** (Ecuador), since 2024  
  *Co-researcher* in an international project on the automated annotation of legal texts, in collaboration with Prof. Danny S. Guam√°n and Prof. Jos√© Estrada.   
  - Demonstrated that GPT-4o can perform multi-label, multi-class annotation of privacy policies with performance close to 80‚Äì90% of human annotators, greatly reducing manual effort.  
  - The results are currently under review for publication ([Preprint DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-5799153/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5799153/v1)), and the annotated corpora will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the article.
- **ETH Zurich** (Switzerland), since 2024  
  *Research collaborator* in an interdisciplinary project led by Prof. Stefan Bechtold and LL.M. Luka Nenadic at the *Center for Law & Economics*.  
  - (Ongoing) Empirical research on on **large-scale multilingual analysis** of privacy policies to evaluate changes following the enforcement of the *New Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP)*.  
- **King‚Äôs College London** (UK), since 2024  
    *Visiting Ph.D. student* at the Department of Informatics, collaborating with Prof. William Seymour and Prof. Jose Such.  
  - Conducted research on automated policy compliance in conversational AI systems, including the development of a framework to evaluate chatbot behaviors against organizational policies.  
  - Research contributed to a joint publication currently under review.
- **Carnegie Mellon University** (USA), since 2022  
  *Visiting Ph.D. student* at the School of Computer Science (2023), hosted by Prof. Norman Sadeh.  
  - Focused on automating the analysis of privacy policies using Large Language Models.  
  - Research collaboration resulted in **seven** joint publications, including papers at PETS and high impact journals.
- **ETH Zurich** (Switzerland), since 2022  
  *Research collaborator* in an interdisciplinary project led by Prof. Amit Zac and Prof. Stefan Bechtold at the *Center for Law & Economics*.  
  - Contributed to empirical research on large-scale automated GDPR compliance auditing.  
  - Co-authored a **working paper in progress**: *‚ÄúThe Court Speaks, But Who Listens? Automated Compliance Review of the GDPR‚Äù* (CLE Working Paper Series 01/2024).

### üß™ Ph.D. Research

**Ph.D. in Privacy Engineering**, *Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM)*
*Defended on July 8, 2025, with the highest honors (cum laude) and international doctorate distinction*

**Thesis title:**  
*Contributions to the Automated Assessment of Mobile Applications‚Äô Compliance with Privacy and Data Protection Requirements*

My research addresses three key layers of analysis in mobile privacy:

- **What applications do:** I perform dynamic and static analyses of Android apps to identify privacy-impacting behavior, using tools like Frida and mitmproxy.
- **What applications say they do:** I apply **LLMs and NLP techniques** to evaluate privacy policies at scale and detect inconsistencies.
- **Who receives the data:** I investigate data recipients and cross-border transfers using network monitoring and IP geolocation strategies.

The outcomes of this work have been published in leading venues like **PETs**, **Computing**, **Computers & Security**, and **IEEE Access**.
