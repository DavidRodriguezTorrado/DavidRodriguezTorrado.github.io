Welcome! I’m Assistant Professor and Ph.D. in Privacy Engineering at the **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)**, member of the Information Processing and Telecommunications Center ([IPTC](https://iptc.upm.es/)) and working within the [STRAST](https://www.upm.es/recursosidi/map/sistemas-de-tiempo-real-y-arquitectura-de-servicios-telematicos/) research group (Real-Time Systems and Service Architecture for Telematics). My research focuses on the **automated assessment of privacy and data protection compliance** in ICT systems, especially in the context of Android mobile apps and GDPR regulation.

### 🎓 About me

Since 2023, I teach **Software Analysis and Design (ADSW)** to second-year students at the **Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación**, where I cover topics like software design, concurrent programming, and complexity analysis in Java.

Between 2021 and 2023, I worked as a Research Assistant at UPM, contributing to the nationally funded research project **AutoGDPR**, focused on automating the assessment of GDPR compliance, by doing privacy policy analysis and data flow auditing. Today, I continue this work as my main research line.

I currently serve as **Organizer** for the [International Workshop on Privacy Engineering (IWPE 2026)](https://iwpe.info/), contributing to the planning, coordination, and execution of the event.

### 🧪 Ph.D. Research

**Ph.D. in Privacy Engineering**, *Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)*.  
*Defended on July 8, 2025, with the highest honors (cum laude) and international doctorate distinction.*  

**Thesis title**: *Contributions to the Automated Assessment of Mobile Applications’ Compliance with Privacy and Data Protection Requirements*

My research addresses three key layers of analysis in mobile privacy:

- **What applications do:** I perform dynamic and static analyses of Android apps to identify privacy-impacting behavior, using tools like Frida and mitmproxy.
- **What applications say they do:** I apply **LLMs and NLP techniques** to evaluate privacy policies at scale and detect inconsistencies with behavior.
- **Who receives the data:** I investigate data recipients and cross-border transfers using network monitoring and IP geolocation strategies.

The outcomes of this work have been published in leading venues like **PETs**, **Computing**, **Computers & Security**, and **IEEE Access**.

### 🛠️ Research Projects

I actively contribute to research projects such as:

- **CEDAR** (*Horizon Europe*): Developing tools for improving public governance transparency, with a focus on knowledge graphs, data modeling and entity resolution.
- **AutoGDPR**: Designing technical solutions to automate GDPR compliance assessment, with public impact in press and academia.
