Welcome! I’m Assistant Professor and Ph.D. in Privacy Engineering at the **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)**, member of the Information Processing and Telecommunications Center ([IPTC](https://iptc.upm.es/)) and working within the [STRAST](https://www.upm.es/recursosidi/map/sistemas-de-tiempo-real-y-arquitectura-de-servicios-telematicos/) research group (Real-Time Systems and Service Architecture for Telematics). My research focuses on the **automated assessment of privacy and data protection compliance** in ICT systems, especially in the context of Android mobile apps and GDPR regulation.

### 🎓 About me

Since 2023, I teach **Software Analysis and Design (ADSW)** to second-year students at the **Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicación**, where I cover topics like software design, concurrent programming, and complexity analysis in Java.

Between 2021 and 2023, I worked as a Research Assistant at UPM, contributing to the nationally funded research project **AutoGDPR**, focused on automating the assessment of GDPR compliance, by doing privacy policy analysis and data flow auditing. Today, I continue this work as my main research line.

I currently serve as **Organizer** for the [International Workshop on Privacy Engineering (IWPE 2026)](https://iwpe.info/), contributing to the planning, coordination, and execution of the event.

  - Focused on automating the analysis of privacy policies using Large Language Models.  
  - Research collaboration resulted in **seven** joint publications, including papers at PETS and high impact journals.
- **ETH Zurich** (Switzerland), 2022-2025  
  *Research collaborator* in an interdisciplinary project led by Prof. Amit Zac and Prof. Stefan Bechtold at the *Center for Law & Economics*.  
  - Contributed to empirical research on large-scale automated GDPR compliance auditing.  
  - Co-authored *“The Court Speaks, But Who Listens? Automated Compliance Review of the GDPR”*, accepted for publication in the Journal of Legal Studies (University of Chicago), scheduled to appear in June 2026 (Vol. 55, No. 2).
- **Escuela Politécnica Nacional and King's College London**, (Ecuador and UK) 2022-2023  
  *Co-author* of a joint research effort on the automated assessment of GDPR compliance for cross-border personal data transfers in Android applications, in colaboration with Prof. Danny S. Guamán and Prof. Jose Such.
  - The collaboration resulted in the paper “Automated GDPR Compliance Assessment for Cross-Border Personal Data Transfers in Android Applications”, which presents a large-scale empirical analysis combining dynamic traffic interception and legal interpretation of international data transfers. Published in *Computers & Security* Journal ([DOI: 10.1016/j.cose.2023.103262](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103262)).

### 🧪 Ph.D. Research

**Ph.D. in Privacy Engineering**, *Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)*.  
*Defended on July 8, 2025, with the highest honors (cum laude) and international doctorate distinction.*  

**Thesis title**: *Contributions to the Automated Assessment of Mobile Applications’ Compliance with Privacy and Data Protection Requirements*

My research addresses three key layers of analysis in mobile privacy:

- **What applications do:** I perform dynamic and static analyses of Android apps to identify privacy-impacting behavior, using tools like Frida and mitmproxy.
- **What applications say they do:** I apply **LLMs and NLP techniques** to evaluate privacy policies at scale and detect inconsistencies with behavior.
- **Who receives the data:** I investigate data recipients and cross-border transfers using network monitoring and IP geolocation strategies.

The outcomes of this work have been published in leading venues like **PETs**, **Computing**, **Computers & Security**, and **IEEE Access**.

### 🛠️ Research Projects

I actively contribute to research projects such as:

- **CEDAR** (*Horizon Europe*): Developing tools for improving public governance transparency, with a focus on knowledge graphs, data modeling and entity resolution.
- **AutoGDPR**: Designing technical solutions to automate GDPR compliance assessment, with public impact in press and academia.
