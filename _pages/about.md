Welcome! I‚Äôm a Teaching Assistant and Ph.D. candidate in Privacy Engineering at the **Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM)**, working within the [STRAST](https://www.upm.es/recursosidi/map/sistemas-de-tiempo-real-y-arquitectura-de-servicios-telematicos/) research group (Real-Time Systems and Service Architecture for Telematics). My research focuses on the **automated assessment of privacy and data protection compliance** in ICT systems, especially in the context of Android mobile apps and GDPR regulation.

### üéì About me

Since 2023, I teach **Software Analysis and Design (ADSW)** to second-year students at the **Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicaci√≥n**, where I cover topics like software design, concurrent programming, and complexity analysis.

Between 2021 and 2023, I worked as a Research Assistant at UPM, contributing to the nationally funded research project **AutoGDPR**, related to GDPR compliance, privacy policy analysis, and data flow auditing.

### üß™ Ph.D. Research

**Thesis title:**  
*Contributions to the Automated Assessment of Mobile Applications‚Äô Compliance with Privacy and Data Protection Requirements*

My research addresses three key layers of analysis in mobile privacy:

- **What applications do:** I perform dynamic and static analyses of Android apps to identify privacy-impacting behavior, using tools like Frida and mitmproxy.
- **What applications say they do:** I apply **LLMs and NLP techniques** to evaluate privacy policies at scale and detect inconsistencies.
- **Who receives the data:** I investigate data recipients and cross-border transfers using network monitoring and IP geolocation strategies.

My work has been published in leading venues like **PETs**, **Computing**, **Computers & Security**, and **IEEE Access**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

I actively contribute to research projects such as:

- **CEDAR (Horizon Europe)** ‚Äì Developing AI-based tools for public governance transparency, with a focus on data modeling and entity resolution.
- **AutoGDPR** ‚Äì Designing technical solutions to automate GDPR compliance assessment, with public impact in press and academia.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ Teaching

Since 2023, I lecture in the second-year undergraduate course **Software Analysis and Design**, where I guide students through core software engineering techniques including:

- **Software design and debugging** fundamentals.
- **Algorithm design and analysis**, including sorting, dictionary structures, and graph algorithms.
- **Concurrent programming** using threads, with emphasis on mutual exclusion, synchronization, and deadlock prevention.
- **Complexity analysis** and architectural design of telecommunication systems.
- **Team-based software development**, version control, and lab exercises linked to real-world communication software challenges.
