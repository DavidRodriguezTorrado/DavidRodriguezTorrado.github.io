I am involved in the **CEDAR project**, funded under the Horizon Europe programme (Grant Agreement No. 101135577). This initiative aims to develop methods, tools, and guidelines for the digitization, protection, and integration of public sector data, tackling critical issues such as corruption and fraud in public administration. CEDAR seeks to establish common European data spaces and deploy robust AI solutions to foster greater transparency and accountability in public governance.

**My contributions to the project include:**

- Developing data analysis tools for detecting patterns of corruption within large-scale datasets.
- Contributing to the creation of high-quality data collections to improve transparency in public sector operations.
