I am involved in the **CEDAR project**, funded under the Horizon Europe programme (Grant Agreement No. 101135577). This initiative aims to develop methods, tools, and guidelines for the digitization, protection, and integration of public sector data, tackling issues such as corruption and fraud in public administration.
