This core course provides students in the Bachelor’s Degree in Telecommunication Technologies and Services Engineering with the foundations and techniques necessary to analyze and design software, particularly in the domain of communication systems.

The syllabus includes:

- **Software design and debugging** fundamentals.
- **Algorithm design and analysis**, including sorting, dictionary structures, and graph algorithms.
- **Concurrent programming** using threads, with emphasis on mutual exclusion, synchronization, and deadlock prevention.
- **Complexity analysis** and architectural design of telecommunication systems.
- **Team-based software development**, version control, and lab exercises linked to real-world communication software challenges.

The course places a strong emphasis on practical work and includes multiple hands-on lab sessions and coding evaluations. The assessment combines written exams and lab-based programming tests.

Students are expected to apply their knowledge from previous courses (Programming and Fundamentals of Telematic Systems) and progressively develop autonomy in designing, implementing, and evaluating complex software systems.
