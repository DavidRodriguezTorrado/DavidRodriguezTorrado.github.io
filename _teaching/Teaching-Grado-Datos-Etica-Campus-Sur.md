I contributed guest lectures to this course in 2024 and 2025, where I introduced key issues surrounding the use of personal data from a legal, ethical, and societal perspective. The sessions focused on automating assessment of data protection regulations (especially the GDPR), transparency, and privacy risks in ITC systems.
